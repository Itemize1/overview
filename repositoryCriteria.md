# Criteria Repository 🚀

Welcome to the Criteria Repository for our project! This document outlines the use of **Conventional Commits** to keep our commit history clean and understandable. Let's make our project collaboration easier and more fun! 🎉

## What are Conventional Commits? 📝

Conventional Commits is a specification for writing standardized commit messages. This helps everyone in the team understand what changes have been made and why. It follows a simple structure:

### Commit Types 🛠️

Here are the main commit types you can use:

- **feat**: A new feature (e.g., `feat: add user registration`)
- **fix**: A bug fix (e.g., `fix: correct user login issue`)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes (e.g., `docs: update API documentation`)
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (e.g., `style: format code style`)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature (e.g., `refactor: simplify user service`)
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests (e.g., `test: add tests for user login`)
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries (e.g., `chore: update dependencies`)

## Examples of Commit Messages 🌟

Here are some examples of commit messages using the Conventional Commits format:

1. **Feature**:  
   ```
   feat(user): add user profile page
   ```

2. **Fix**:  
   ```
   fix(auth): resolve password hashing issue
   ```

3. **Documentation**:  
   ```
   docs(readme): update project description
   ```

4. **Style**:  
   ```
   style(button): improve button hover effects
   ```

5. **Refactor**:  
   ```
   refactor(database): optimize database queries
   ```

6. **Test**:  
   ```
   test(user): add tests for user creation
   ```

7. **Chore**:  
   ```
   chore(deps): update express to version 4.17.1
   ```

## Benefits of Using Conventional Commits 🌈

- **Clarity**: Makes it easier to understand the purpose of changes.
- **Automation**: Tools can automatically generate changelogs based on commit messages.
- **Consistency**: Everyone follows the same format, leading to a uniform commit history.

## Conclusion 🎊

By using Conventional Commits in our project, we can improve our collaboration and make it easier for everyone to understand changes. Let's commit to writing clear and consistent messages! Happy coding! 💻✨
